# keeping_record
Suppose a track and field coach wanted to keep track of their athletes and their personal records. This program can write and manage a file that contains each athlete’s name, as well as their personal best performance. This program makes it easy to lookup an athlete’s PR, add new athletes, remove graduated seniors, and update stored PRs. This program will also prevent identically named athletes, prevent a PR that is lower than the current one from being entered, save the file every time a change is made, and produce a human-readable file, with one name and number per line.
